# AWG_python_work
This is a program I began for work.
I need to archive a samba shared drive of about 5.5TB in size, it has many subdirectories and a large number of duplicates.
it walks the directories and hashes files to find duplicates
it then filter out duplicates and uninteresting file types.
it then renames all files replacien 'Y:\direcotry\folder\file.exp' with 'direcotry_folder_file.exp' 
the goal index all these files with Solr and make the contents searchable.
